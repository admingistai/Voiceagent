        "title": "VERTEX Athletic Company Overview",
        "content": "VERTEX Athletic is an athletic footwear company founded in 2018 by a team of mountaineers, trail runners, and environmental scientists. The company was born at 14,000 feet on a failed summit attempt of Mount Rainier when founders realized their gear wasn't designed for modern outdoor athletes who move seamlessly between city streets and mountain peaks. Their mission is 'Reach Your Peak' - creating gear that helps everyone reach their own summit, whether it's a first 5K, ultra-marathon, or staying active with family.",
